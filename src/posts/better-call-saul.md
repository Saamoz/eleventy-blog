This kind of post might seem a little bit unusual compared to the stuff I usually write. Typically I try to write about interesting things happening in my life or fun ideas I have - not write a review on one of the most popular shows on TV. Surely this has already been done to death right? Who needs another review for something that's already so critically acclaimed; any critic will readily provide you a great list of reasons why Better Call Saul deserves watching.

However, there's two reasons why I think this is worth writing. The first is to get my thoughts on this show off my chest. That is the biggest reason I write after all - I write for myself. Because I like recording what I'm thinking, and because writing allows you to come up with all sorts of thoughts you wouldn't otherwise have. By the end of this, I imagine my feelings towards Better Call Saul will not only be much more settled and easier to express, but also I'm sure I'll pick up some new ideas along the way. You can't force this process; the only way is to write.

The other reason is that I'm not a huge fan of how many typical reviews are written. I'm sure some people enjoy them, but they don't really make me want to watch or read something. _Better Call Saul is a quirky, dark character study that manages to stand on its own without being overshadowed by the series that spawned it_. I'm sure it is, but what does that actually mean? Character studies are cool I guess, but that doesn't tell me many details about what sets this apart. 

Likewise, many of the reviews in comments often read as like _An indisputable 10/10. Excellent acting, music, visuals, plot, and dialogue. Literally the best show of all time, I'm leaving my life savings to Vince Gilligan_. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but not much (go check out some IMDB reviews and you'll see). Again, you have to remember that reviews are written for people who've never seen this so saying how much you love it is interesting but still doesn't tell you much about the show. For the record, I did really enjoy Better Call Saul but when recommending it to others I think it's better to discuss specific features of the show rather than how much I personally enjoyed it.

When it comes to media, I would typically rather see something that a small number of people loved than something a larger number of people merely liked. Even if a show is divisive and hard to love, the fact that some people do love it and feel passionate about it is a much stronger endorsement that thousands of 4/5s. Media like that often has something to say, something unique and interesting that makes it stand out, and that's what I'm really looking for in a show or a book (or a game or a movie or a song or a play).

So when reviewing something, like say Better Call Saul, I want to focus on the things that I personally loved about it. Sure, this isn't some sleeper indie loved by few but hated by many - it's broadly quite popular, but importantly people do love it. Instead of discussing the plot, acting, and visuals in isolation like a traditional review there are some specific things I really enjoyed that I would rather discuss. And of course Better Call Saul is exceptional at all of those criteria, but so are a dozen other shows that lack the special sauce of Better Call Saul. That uniqueness is what I'd like to pick apart.

Some disclaimers: I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum, but I will be discussing some of the basic aspects of the show like it's characters and its premise. I'll also make a few comparisons to Breaking Bad, which is necessary is Better Call Saul is really an evolution of everything the creators pioneered in their first show, but again I'll try not to spoil anything other than the basics. So, here goes.

## Taking Life Slow 

The first thing that struck me about Better Call Saul was the cinematography. Not just the fact that it is technically impressive, but the way the cinematography works with the pacing and the rhythm of the show. You see, it's not shot like a traditional thirty minute thriller or hour long drama. People describe it as a slow burn, but I think that's understating it. Better Call Saul is a show that knows how to take it's time, and how to revel in the subtle beauty of each moment.

You see, the slow pacing of the show is very deliberate. It can be one of the show's biggest strengths if you're willing to give it your time and attention span. Part of it may be due to its appreciation of the western genre, which often takes its time and lingers on shots of wide open expanses and big blue skies. It's hard to give you a taste of what this is like just through writing, but let me give it a try.

Imagine your own life as if it were a tv show or movie. Take an everyday scene of something you do every night, let's say making pasta for dinner. Really imagine it, picture what you're seeing through your mental camera as artistically framed as possible. How does it look?

Is it a tightly edited, snappy montage of you boiling the pasta, stirring the sauce, grating the cheese? Something like that might be right at home in a viral tiktok video perhaps. Or maybe, if you like taking your time with things, this little mental movie lingers on the small details. The lid of the pot slowly steaming up until a little droplet of water finally condenses, and then slowly meanders its way down to drip back into the pot. Your indecision while picking a knife as your hand slowly hovers over each one, and then as you take your chosen knife out of frame the camera pauses on the one that was left behind so that your decision really sinks in. That second example is what describes the visual style of Better Call Saul, and is what I came to love.

Not only does the show exude style from of the technical brilliance of each of their shots, but nothing else I've found on TV is willing to spend so much of its audience's time on these things; close ups of the actors as they slowly mull over an idea or on a love car slowly driving down a road with the brilliant blue sky shining in the background. Some episodes might devote ten minutes to a character slowly and deliberately surveilling a target without a shred of dialogue. It makes sense that in today's busy world this might not have general appeal, but I loved seeing how the creators could dramatize and beautify little moments of everyday life.

I appreciate shows that reward the viewer for giving them their full attention, and this is another area where the slow pacing shines. Each of these long, deliberate scenes are not there just to pad out the episode length; they tell you little stories about the characters or the world. This is not a show you could listen to in the background while doing something else. It takes some thought and focus to put together what the creators mean, especially in the quiet scenes when all the best acting is happening in a few quick glances.

Of course, this lack of action and focus on the artistic side of cinematography enables new and intricate ways of digging deep into the characters. Spending time on the subtleties of the actors' little moments and the tiniest expressions on their faces lets you get to know them and fleshes them out more than most other media I've seen. That helps contribute to one of Better Call Saul's greatest strengths: in addition to the extremely talented main character, each of the supporting actors are more complex and scene-stealing than the leads in some other pieces of media.

I sometimes like to imagine my life as a show - perhaps with days being episodes and years being seasons. Most days are pretty uneventful - I'll bike somewhere new or spend some time cooking dinner. There's not always a lot of action or drama, but does that make it uninteresting? Could the mundane, boring tasks I do everyday be framed in such a way as to draw out the beauty and drama inherent in everything in do? If the creators of Better Call Saul were in charge of doing so, I firmly believe they could. It's changed how I view the things I do, and for that I am grateful that I watched this show.

## The Superpower of Talking

I think perhaps now it's time to discuss the main attraction. The titular Saul Goodman, sleazy lawyer running scams and defending the worst criminals in Albuquerque. All of the usual things about his performance apply: he's an excellent actor with incredible range, has great chemistry with the other leads, and nails the role. However there's one particular aspect of his I want to highlight, something that I think he does really well.

One way to describe the character of Saul might be as a con man. I think con magician might fit better, since watching him work is like magic. It takes an incredible actor with an huge amount of charisma to convincingly pull off what Saul is capable of. No matter what situation he is in, no matter how bad it is, he can almost always get out of it with his quick thinking and witty words. It's amazing to watch him feign sadness or anger, and he portrays it well enough that you can see the cunning layer of wit behind whatever facade he's putting up.

Sometimes I like to take my favorite superheros and drop them into the middle of other pieces of media, and imagine how they would do. What if Spiderman was in John Wick? How would Batman do in an Oceans 11 heist? It's fun because this typically highlights how strong these characters' powers are. That's what superpowers do, they make you greater than regular humans. They set you free of the fear and impotence that someone would typically have in a scary situation.

As I watched Better Call Saul, that's essentially how I started to think about Saul's ability to plan and trick and scheme. Sure, he's not all powerful and he'd probably lose in a regular fist fight with most people, but when his power shines it really is impressive. I started imagining dropping him into John Wick or an Oceans 11 heist and I think, against all odds, if he had time to plan and people to talk to he'd do quite well. He has an uncanny ability to convince people, to wrap them around his finger and make the rules of a system work for him. It's really amazing to watch and it makes me wonder.

Unlike super strength or flight, Saul's 'power' is entirely possible if a little bit exaggerated. Surely there are very successful people out there like him; people who can talk their way into anything. Even I could get better at that with a little practice and some bits of charisma. It wouldn't quite be a superpower, but there's a lesson in there to take home. You can get surprisingly far if you know how to give people what they want. Even if he sometimes uses his powers for bad, it's nice seeing what he can do when his heart is (occasionally) in the right place.

## A Flair for Showmanship

Saul is the kind of person who is always putting on a show. In the courthouse, he is playing the role of a respectable defense lawyer to the judge and the jury. On the streets, he's presenting himself as a tough, street smart individual who's not to be messed with. When running a con of some kind, he's someone else entirely, putting himself into the role of a waiter or millionaire or coin expert. And, most of all, the biggest show he puts on is the one he does to himself.


<!-- VISUAL STORYTELLING

There's a genre that used to be very popular in Hollywood; the western. If you're like me, you don't really know much about westerns; you've probably never even really heard of them. I learned a little more about the genre as I continued to watch Better Call Saul, and eventually decided that I seemed to like it. Better Call Saul is not really a western (though some might call it a neo-western because these days everything is neo-something), but I think it draws alot of inspiration from that genre.

What really makes a genre distinct is more than a setting or a plot. Sci-fi is more than just space stations. Fantasy is more than medieval lands and magic. With cyberpunk many people focus on the cyber and forget about the punk. A genre is a set of ideas, a feeling or a vibe. Better Call Saul may not be about a cowboy roaming around the American frontier (though it does have its share of desert scenes like its predecessor), but the feelings I got from it really reminded me of my favorite parts of a western.

What are these feelings that I associate with the genre? An appreciation for the wilderness, with wide open shots filled with mountain ranges and big blue skies. A focus on morality, freedom, justice. An aversion to the law, with violence

NEO WESTERN, GENRE IS MORE THAN SETTING AND PLOT BUT IT IS A VIBE -->

MASTERCLASS

If I had to sum it up, I think Better Call Saul is the ultimate TV Show. Not because it's necessarily the best show of all time, but because it exemplifies the strengths of the medium to the fullest extent; it tells a story that another medium just couldn't equivalently convey. The visuals which can only shine due to the time and care that was put into them, unfeasible in a movie or a game. The way that the actors grew with their roles, and the way that the roles in turn grew with their actors. The way it built off of an already extremely successful property, which let the creators perfect their own formula over the span of a decade. All of it makes for a transcendant viewing experience.
