On the 4th of April, 2021, I won a tournament. It wasn't for a sport, just an online video game that I play with friends. It wasn't a big tournament, just me and 7 friends. Yet, despite that, the excitement and relief I felt after winning was incomparable. I exulted in the joy of that triumph for weeks, and in that moment winning meant more to me than really it probably should have.

That joy I felt there wasn't really about the game itself, although the game in question, Starcraft 2, is a fun game that I still play from time to time. Deep down, it wasn't really about spending time with friends either. I elated in the unique thrill I only experience after being triumphant in some kind of competition or tournament. Some situation where I set my mind on defeating something or someone, train for it, and succeed after great hardship; these are what awakens the beast in me.

In fact, this is precisely what happened in the Starcraft 2 tournament. It was in fact the second such tournament we had held; in the first one a few months before this I made it to the finals but lost in the last game of a best of 5 after trying my hardest. It was this experience that steeled my resolve and motivated me to practice hard for this tournament. In the end I reached the finals again facing the same person, and I managed to defeat them without losing a single game. It was certainly a satisfying victory.


## Competition

What this whole saga made me realize is that I am quite a competitive person. I had already kind of known it beforehand,but this brought that fact into startling clarity. A year before I won my tournament I'd never heard of Starcraft 2. I was introduced by a friend, and it was largely his influence that awakened my competitive instinct. The key here was that he was just a passionate as I was.

Starcraft 2 is a difficult game. It involves controlling an army that can consist of hundreds of individual units, and is a true test of your reaction speed and multitasking abilities. I wouldn't have dedicated so much time into learning it if I didn't have a good reason, but luckily I did. My friend is also very competitive and he frequently challenged me to games from right when I started. At first it might have just been because he enjoyed beating me at something, but our matches grew less and less one-sided until we both fought hard for victory every time.

Each time one of us would become slightly better, the new streak of losses would motivate the other to practice until we were roughly equally skilled. We were in a relentless but virtuous cycle of competition and self-improvement that took me from someone who'd never even heard of the game all the way to the best in the friend group. We both refused to lose to the other, and with each win would come a series of (friendly) taunts which only steeled our resolves to improve.

I find learning and improving to be one of the most satisfying feelings in life, and this was no different. I fondly recall the first time I was able to beat each one of my friends, as if I was some bounty hunter ticking each one off my list. This wasn't an easy process, and I had to work for each victory, but that made it all the more rewarding. Ultimately, winning that tournament was a culmination of everything I had worked towards which made it intensely gratifying.

Any kind of sport or competitive activity can create this rush. This time, it happened to be Starcraft 2. But I don't intend for it to be the last.

## Friendship and Teamwork

Being competitive is not always a solo activity. In fact, I think some of the best moments are when you're a member of a tightly knit team, working together to do the impossible. There's a phrase about how some friends are made face to face and others are made shoulder to shoulder, the idea being that some of the strongest bonds are forged when you and your friends stand side by side, ready to take on the world. I have to say, it's an intoxicating give something your all with a group of peers who care just as much as you do.

If you've never experienced this, I highly recommend you try it. Find a group of like-minded friends, set aside a weekend or two, and conquer the world. Or just some tiny piece of the world. Shoot a film, climb a mountain, cook a feast. These are all difficult but transformative experiences that will not only cause you grow, but you will get closer to your friends and see them in a new light. This is why I always enjoyed hackathons - a weekend dedicated to building a piece of software from scratch, with nothing but teamwork and willpower.

One of the important part of all the ideas I suggested, and something that is core to a good competitive experience, is that they are all difficult. I think that's something that's sometimes overlooked when planning what to do, why willingly choose to make things difficult for yourself? Perhaps this is a matter of personal preference, but doing hard things, conquering them, is so vastly rewarding. There is a sweet spot of difficulty to be sure, and I think video games have done a good job of identifying that range, but right in that sweet spot where the competitive spirit shines? That's when I feel most alive.

These don't have to be intensely difficult either. In fact, setting unreachable goals does the opposite of a good competition; it shuts down the part of you that schemes and strategizes because the goal seems too far away. Finding something just within the bounds of your ability, but barely, is what is the most thrilling to attempt and satisfying to succeed at. Taking the bus to a new part of down or even making a scary phone could be the highlight of someone's week, and I think that's amazing.

On the converse, something too easy doesn't work either. I've been asked to learn dances before, and I was advised to start with the easy stuff to get used to it. The problem was that the easy dances weren't interesting at all. When I dance I want to exude energy like a spinning ball of fire, not to endlessly repeat 4 basic moves. Despite the greater difficulty, if doing the hard thing awakens the competitive beast within then I say to do it.

So of course finding something right in the sweet spot is a wonderful feeling. Even seeing others who land on the sweet spot can be beautiful to watch. I saw a [documentary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15166116/) about [:Inspiration 4](#Inspiration), about the four civilians who went to space. These were four complete strangers, only one of whom had any experience with aeronautics whatsoever. In the span of a year, they went from not knowing each other to trusting each other with their lives. Through a grueling battery of exercises and tests over the span of about a year, they lived together and supported each other and grew closer than even some families do. All because it was for a mission that they all believed in. That awakened each of their competitive spirits. It was absolutely mesmerizing to watch. 

It takes some experimentation to find the perfect combination of factors that can turn an otherwise tedious task into a wonderfully dynamic competition. It takes even more to find one that works for everybody in the team. But if you do, it will create memories that last a lifetime.

## Recipe for a Good Competition

So what specifically does it take for me to find something to be beautifully competitive? Well, let's walk through the recipe using an example I've recently become quite interested in: chess.

First, we need an activity. It has to be complex enough that strategic depth is possible, and popular enough that there's something like a community surrounding it. That means simple games like tic-tac-toe and obscure games like fascinating yet hard to find [star wars board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/187645/star-wars-rebellion) are out of the picture. I've only recently noticed how important a community is for jumpstarting my interest in something. It's so much easier to care about something when tons of others care as well.

Luckily, chess fits that perfectly. It's famously strategic, enough that even after thousands of years new tactics and positions are being found. There's a huge community surrounding the game, one that seems to only be growing. It's really fun to follow up on the latest chess drama, pick up some strategic tips and then try to implement those ideas in my own games later that day. Plus, the memes are absolutely hilarious. I wish I could share them here, but they require enough chess knowledge that they'd be incomprehensible.

Ok, so we have a potential activity that could turn into a competitive masterpiece. What's next? I need someone in my life to play it with. Ideally someone who's just as interested as I am, who will motivate me to play and improve, and who's at approximately the same skill level. I've had lots of friends who play chess throughout the years, but my latest one is different. I started a new job recently, and every day at lunch time we squeeze in a few games of chess. Not only are our skill levels close enough that the games are always tense, the key here is our consistency; by playing every single day against the same person at the same time you start to develop your own strategy, your own meta.

Previously I would play a few games of chess here and there but never with enough regularity to improve. Now, I refuse to be beaten by the same person every day for weeks (which is what happened when we started), which has lit a fire under me. What's really fun about doing the same thing with the same person over the span of weeks or months is what you end up learning about them. You need to know them well to eventually beat them. To be able to pick up on the risks they're willing to take, what makes them excited and what doesn't, little pieces of their psyche that only comes out while competing. It's a beautiful process, and one I'm always glad to be a part of.

So now the two of us have been playing chess for a while. I've been improving enough to not lose every game, but my competitive drives have not yet been fully engaged. Now, we come to the last and most important piece. The special sauce, the _je ne sais quoi_. The part that will compel me to practice and train until I emerge victorious. This factor is hard to predict, and is different for each game. For Starcraft 2, it might have been the moment where I beat my very first friend, and I realized maybe I have a chance at this whole video game thing I'm not sure. But, I know exactly what happened for chess.

Some people at my company have organized an interoffice tournament, with some other companies in the industry. At first I wasn't too sure about signing up; the chess we play at lunch is super casual and we play pretty fast. In this tournament, you're playing for points and each game has 1 hour allotted to each player. That means the game could last up to 2 hours! That's a long time sitting in a chair and thinking about moving pieces around on a board. I was pretty nervous before we started, and I wondered if I even had the attention span to think about chess for 2 hours straight. Well, it turns out I had nothing to fear.

I like to take things slow, and I took my tournament game as slow as I could. It was almost a meditative experience; I was worried about my attention wandering but actually thinking through every move to the best of my capability was thrilling! I sure wasn't doing that over my lunchtime games. Time passed faster than it ever did before while playing a game, and that's when I felt it. The thrill of competition rising up once again. That's when I knew I wouldn't be able to put this game down anytime soon.

I lost my game of course. I was playing against a much better player than me, and at least I learned a lot. But, after that we, I won my next game at the next meet! It was an amazing feeling to emerge triumphant; I felt powerful.
