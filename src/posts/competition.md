On the 4th of April, 2021, I won a tournament. It wasn't for a sport, just an online video game that I play with friends. It wasn't a big tournament, just me and 7 others. Yet, despite that, the excitement and relief I felt after winning was incomparable. I exulted in the joy of that triumph for weeks, in that moment of winning meant more to me than really it probably should have.

That joy I felt there wasn't really about the game itself, although the game in question, Starcraft 2, is a fun game that I still play from time to time. Deep down, it wasn't really about spending time with friends either. I elated in the unique thrill I only experience after being triumphant in some kind of competition or tournament. Some situation where I set my mind on defeating something or someone, train for it, and succeed after great hardship; these are what awakens the beast in me.

In fact, this is precisely what happened in the Starcraft 2 tournament. It was in fact the second such tournament we had held; in the first one a few months before this I made it to the finals but lost in the last game of a best of 5 after trying my hardest. It was this experience that steeled my resolve and motivated me to practice hard for this tournament. In the end I reached the finals again facing the same person, and I managed to defeat them without losing a single game. It was certainly a satisfying victory.


## Competition

What this whole saga made me realize is that I am quite a competitive person. I had already kind of known it beforehand,but this brought that fact into startling clarity. A year before I won my tournament I'd never heard of Starcraft 2. I was introduced by a friend, and it was largely his influence that awakened my competitive instinct. The key here was that he was just a passionate as I was.

Starcraft 2 is a difficult game. It involves controlling an army that can consist of hundreds of individual units, and is a true test of your quick thinking and multitasking abilities. I wouldn't have dedicated so much time into learning it if I didn't have a good reason, but luckily I did. My friend is also very competitive and he frequently challenged me to games from right when I started. At first it might have just been because he enjoyed beating me at something, but our matches grew less and less one-sided until we both fought hard for victory every time.

Each time one of us would become slightly better, the new streak of losses would motivate the other to practice until we were roughly equally skilled. We were in a relentless but virtuous cycle of competition and self-improvement that took me from someone who'd never even heard of the game all the way to the best in our little friend group.
