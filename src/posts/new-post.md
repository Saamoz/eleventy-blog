So, here we are. After plenty of deliberating, procrastinating, and brainstorming, I've finally ended up with this blog. If you're reading this, there's a good chance I asked you for help with the design or the name or just plain old motivation, so thank you for that. This is still kind of a first draft of both the website and the whole blogging idea in general, so if you have any feedback or ideas please let me know.

Despite having one short-lived experiment in high school, this feels like my first time doing anything like this. I have lots of thoughts in my head and I'm a decent writer, but it remains to be seen whether I'll be able to combine these two things. There's lots of different directions I could take this; essays, fiction, art, life updates, poetry, journaling. It feels a little overwhelming since I have at least a little bit of interest in all of these things, but I hope I'll be able to satisfy my own need to produce a variety of content.

Picking a name for this was really tricky, but I think I'm happy with how it ended up. Saad's Scribbles gives me an artsy vibe which is not something I was planning to do much of, but maybe this will motivate me to create and post more art. I also like the unpretentious feel; I would probably push myself to produce fewer higher quality essays on something like Saad's Codex, but for better or for worse it feels like I can dump whatever I want onto here. I'm not sure what balance I should have between only posting high quality polished content and using it more as a stream of consciousness journal but I'm confident I'll work it out.

Anyway, this is meant as more of an introduction so I'll end it here. I intend to muse more about the types of content I want on this blog so expect a discussion of that coming in the next few weeks. Overall though I'm feeling good about this whole experiment so far, let's see how it goes.
