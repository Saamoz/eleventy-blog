I've been doing some thinking about the types of adventures I'd love to go on, and I happened to recall one of my favorite things I've recently done. I didn't intend to do many retrospectives here when I started; I'd rather look forward instead, but I feel like this was cool enough for me to make an exception. So what exactly was it? Essentially, I designed, planned, and then competed in a big scavenger hunt all over downtown Toronto which I found to be one of the most fulfilling activities I'd ever done.

So firstly, a little background. I conceived of this when I was trying to come up with something that combined all of my favorite kinds of activities. I love cities, and traversing them in many different ways (whether that be by bike, on foot, with transit, or more). I'm somewhat competitive, and wanted a (preferably meaningless) challenge that let me compete against my friends. I enjoy excuses to exercise my creativity, and it would be great if I this challenge encourages brainstorming unique and obscure ways to complete it. I'd spent a long time with these ideas at the back of my mind, but they never crystallized into anything concrete; just a vague urge to race my friends sometimes or to vault fences for no reason. That was until I started putting the dots together and figured out exactly what I was looking for.

## The Design of the Hunt

I was inspired to do this by traditional scavenger hunts, but I felt they lacked something. It's fun to go around and try to spot a specific leaf or funny hat but these items often feel arbitrary; they require more luck than actual skill to track down. Additionally, since I was leaving Toronto around that time I wanted to do something that really tested and rewarded knowledge of the city. I looked online but many of these seemed more aimed at tourists, showcasing attractions over the actual knowledge of the city (I didn't want to just visit the CN Tower, City Hall, and the AGO). And frantically racing from landmark to landmark just to take a photo with it seemed a bit simplistic - where's the challenge in that!

On a random weekday evening I just started coming up with challenges that sounded much more interesting to me, and sharing these ideas with my friends. At this point I had no serious plans to put something together, but sometimes just putting an idea into the world gives it a life of its own. At this point, I had little control over idea I'd birthed and the list of challenges just kept growing; it seemed I'd have little choice but to actually run the scavenger hunt.

So what did I do differently compared to the other scavenger hunts I just described? First of all
