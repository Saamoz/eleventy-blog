Almost an entire year ago, I moved from Toronto to Chicago for work. These two cities are extremely similar, in climate, geography, size, and culture. However, due to a quirk of politics, they happen to have an international border between them despite being just a couple hours flight or a single day's drive away. This meant that when I moved I was not just changing my city of residence. Suddenly, I had become an expatriate.

Of course, a Canadian working in the US is far less culturally jarring than most other expatriate situations. Regardless, changing countries always involves switching to an entirely new legal, civil, and bureaucratic infrastructure, and this can sometimes run into problems. You may even encounter the most dreaded beast of all: immigration problems.

As usual, this post is inspired by other stories I've read. [18 Years A Transient](https://software.rajivprab.com/2022/05/10/18-years-a-transient), for example, chronicle's an Indian engineer's long and arduous path towards gaining permanent residency in the USA. Before even getting started I'll say that the experience he went through, and that tens pf thousands of others of immigrants go through each year, is far far worse than anything that happened to me. If you want a showcase of some of the worst contradictions and consequences of what it's like to be a foreigner working in America, you should really check that out.

This, on the other hand, isn't intended to be some great expose on the flaws of the USA's immigration system. Unlike the story I linked above, the roadblocks I faced were not intentionally set by the United States government. Rather than being a product of messy immigration laws and political infighting, my problems were simply a mix of technological issues, bureaucratic delay, and largely were directly caused or exacerbated by myself. I look back on it all mostly with a sense of faint amusement rather than any real frustration at the institutions that were involved.

<!-- Really, I think this story says more about me than it does about America's laws or bureaucracy. -->

To explain what actually happened, we need to go all the way back to 2021

## December 2021 - Job Offer

In December of 2021, I got the job that would lead to me moving to Chicago. And, that's about all of the relevant parts from this month. Ok, maybe we didn't need to go back this far...

## April 2022 - First Visit

Here we go. Because I didn't graduate until June 22, I didn't start working for a while. The first time I actually visited the US for anything related to the job was in April of 2022, where all of the new hires visited for a weekend to introduce ourselves and get familiar with the company.

Of course, I've visited the US many times before. As a Canadian it's very easy; at the border you tell them you're visiting for leisure and they let you in without even stamping your passport. Technically they only let you in for six months at a time, but there are stories of Canadians staying for much longer. There are few consequences, and really it's a sign of how closely these two countries cooperate and how intertwined the societies are.

At the border I told them I'm just there for a weekend and they let me right away. In fact it was even easier than that. I happen to be enrolled in the Global Entry program which means a machine scans my face and assigns me the correct visa (in this case B2, which is the standard temporary visa for Canadians) automatically. I appreciated the convenience in the moment but this seemingly innocuous technology will return later in the story. I thought nothing of it, bypassing the entire line at the border, but don't make the same mistake I did.

Anyway the rest of the trip went by without a hitch, and I returned home with nary a concern on my mind.

## July 2022 - The First Real Entrance

Now is a good moment to explain some of the relevant laws regarding working in other countries. In the US, aliens (meaning non-citizens) are not allowed to work by default. To do so, you need to obtain a visa specifically letting you reside and work in the country. Oftentimes this is done to filter out the lowest quality workers - they want to keep the poor labourers and minimum wage employees out while letting the wealthy lawyers and engineers in. Whether or not you believe this is efficient or moral, it's simply how nations work and just about every single one has a system like this in place.

There are a few ways for people to get long term work visas. The very rich or the very famous have it pretty easy, with very little wait. The most common way if you have a university degree is to apply for something called an H1-B visa which is pretty universally despised by all who have the misfortune to need it. There is a literal lottery to get this visa, which wasn't so bad a few decades go when the odds were decent. But now there's only about a 20% chance of getting it with only 3 tries before they must leave the country. Seriously, look at this excerpt from the article at the top:

> Each year, across all of America, there’s a maximum of 85,000 new H1B visas that will be awarded – 20,000 of which are reserved for those with advanced degrees from an American university. If there are more qualified applicants than this limit, a lottery is used to randomly decide who gets the visa and who doesn’t – incentivizing companies to stuff the lottery with as many applicants as possible, in order to maximize the company’s odds. At one of my internships, we used to host “The Deported” parties every year in order to bid farewell to colleagues who got unlucky in the lottery and had to leave the country.

> This is the single biggest source of legal anxiety that immigrant workers face. Imagine losing your job, and on top of the usual financial concerns, you now also have a 60-day deadline to find a new job. And if you’ve spent the first 45 days interviewing only to wind up with rejection notices, you now have just 15 days to withdraw your kids from school, pack up all your belongings, buy plane tickets and hotel accommodations, and move your family to a new country

There are a lot more juicy details to this system, including the fact that H1-B is a temporary work visa. Even after getting it there's a long long path to permanent residency and getting a green card. That's all down a huge tangent though, since the visa I was getting was not an H1-B.

Luckily for me, the USA has an agreement with Canada and Mexico under NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) to allow certain professionals to be employed in America. This happens to be bilateral, so Americans and Mexicans can use the same method to come and work in Canada. It's all designed to be very straightforward and simple, unlike the arduous process involving the H1-B. You don't even need to fill out any special forms - you just show up at the border with the right documentation and they almost always let you in. Key word being almost.

Before we get to the actual scene of my border crossing, there's something you have to understand about me. I'm very optimistic, to a fault even. I really don't believe that things will go wrong, and they generally haven't. I do concede that there are some situations where perhaps I should approach with a little bit more care. Despite everything that happened however, including the events of this day, I still firmly believe this is the best attitude to carry throughout life.

So about a month before I started work, I moved to the US to get settled in and prepare my new apartment. To do that, I traveled from Toronto to Chicago the exact same way I did last time, and I was anticipating a painless border experience once again. They would have waved me right through without any issues, except that I chose that moment to apply for a TN visa. 

This was technically the correct procedure, except I didn't have any of the necessary paperwork or know any of the procedures to properly apply. In that moment part of me wondered if I should be more careful, having only skimmed the requirements and only knowing that you apply at a port of entry but not exactly how; in the end, though, I knew that nothing bad could really happen whereas something interesting could. I just cast my die into the wind, abandoned myself to fate, and trusted that no matter what my unshakable faith and optimism would carry me through.

They brought us into secondary inspection and the agent became quite exasperated that I was here with literally zero documentation for the TN visa apart from a few haphazard screenshots on my phone. She was quite terse, and this was a fairly stressful moment because all the while I was expected to pick up the keys to my new apartment, the IKEA people were calling to arrange delivery, and I was supposed to meet my parents later that day. I admit, for a moment I was slightly concerned about what might happen but that thankfully didn't last long.

Eventually, after consulting with a manager, the agent decided she could let me into the country on a regular visa as long as I pinkie promised not to start work before leaving the country and reentering with the correct documentation. I found this to be relatively gracious, after reading horror stories online about what the agents can do if they find you suspicious. However, my brother who was with me at the time found the whole experience to be quite harrowing, to a surprisingly deep degree. Clearly we didn't share the same faith that nothing really could have gone wrong.

Anyway the rest of that trip went smoothly if a little chaotically. I had no other issues dealing with any levels of government, and eventually my workplace mailed me the documents I needed for the TN visa. Armed with everything I needed, I headed back to Canada to get the visa for real.

## August 2022 -- Getting the Visa

Like I covered above, getting a TN visa is supposed to be straightforward for Canadians. You show up, ask nicely, maybe share some documents, and then you're home free. The idea is that you can do this whole thing at the airport quick enough that you'll make your flight. The Toronto Pearson Airport does the processing for US entry right there, to make it extra convenient. Unfortunately it didn't go as smoothly as I planned.

I was planning to get my TN visa and fly back to the US after a brief stay in Canada, just long enough to get some stuff I'd left and say goodbye. To that end, I was carrying two huge boxes of stuff, one of which had my computer parts and so I needed to be careful. As per my plan I arrived at the airport extremely early, and painstakingly lugged around these boxes to the check in desk and then to the oversized luggage area. After finally relieving myself of this burden, I went through US customs and asked for a TN visa.

The tired looking agent barely glanced in my direction before pointing me to the dreaded _Secondary Inspection_. At this point I was still feeling fairly upbeat, and with over two hours to my flight it seemed like I'd be fine. However when I saw the amount of people waiting in here with me I started to get nervous. I didn't know it at the time, but a popular Caribbean festival called Caribana had just finished, which meant hundreds of festival goers were likely trying to fly back to the US.

There were at least a few other TN applicants sharing my plight. At one point one of the agents even announced that if any of us wanted to just enter the US and skip getting their special visa he'd just let us through, because there would be significant delay. Of course I didn't accept that option since I still had a few days until I started work and had time to get authorized, but it didn't bode well.

Still though, I was in a pleasant mood. I find places like airports to be eminently fascinating, and here I had a chance to watch people at their best and (more often) their worst moments. There were some colossal freakouts and some fascinating stories to be heard, and I was spending my time people watching. Eventually the time of my flight came and went but still I persevered; I figured I might as make sure to get the visa and they'd probably put me on another flight tomorrow.

Finally, my moment of truth arrived. I was called up by an agent to look at my application package. He asked me a few questions about what the company did and my role in it, but to my horror he denied my application. I learned that many other Canadian trainees, who drove instead of flew, used the exact same application package to make it through in just a few minutes. Here I was after waiting for 3 or 4 hours only to be denied.

I think this illustrates another essential part of any bureaucratic process that just can't be controlled - an element of luck. Somethings things just go your way, and sometimes they don't through no fault of your own. Maybe the agent was having a bad day or maybe there really was a flaw in the application. Either way, I was cast out of the airport and sent to collect my bags. To make things even worse, I had to wait another hour for my two huge boxes to be sent back outside and for someone to come pick me up.

The one saving grace in all of this was that my new workplace was extremely sympathetic throughout this entire process. They assured me that I did nothing wrong and arranged to send me new documents overnight so I could try again tomorrow. After doing some frantic research for new flights and planning out my next day, I finally had some well deserved sleep.

## August 2022 (still) -- Getting the Visa Part 2

The plan for today was essentially identical to yesterday. I got to the airport early, lugged my two huge boxes around until the oversize luggage area was open to check them in, shambled through US security with practiced ease, and declared that I was applying for a TN visa. And then, the waiting began.

I was started to get a little bit low on reading material, having exhausted most of it during my 4 hour wait yesterday. Plus I didn't want to use headphones in case there was some juicy drama happening that I would miss out on. I was still feeling confident overall, if a little less so, and there was still plenty of people watching for me to amuse myself with. As the wait stretched on, however, it seemed like it would be no better than yesterday. If true, that would mean once again missing my flight. I wouldn't even mind that too much as long as I got the visa.

Amusingly, some of the agents started to recognize me. One of them who seemed a little bit younger than the others and a little bit friendlier than the others was my favorite. I gave him a nod as I walked in; I thought it was funny to be seeing him again for the second day in a row. He even called me up after I arrived, I think mostly out of curiosity, and I explained the situation to him.

So, the hours passed. I got lots of reading done and some more fun stories, like the lady who had a breakfast orange in her purse and so had to miss her flight. Or the family going to Disney World for the first time. Once again the time of my flight quickly passed, but I remained unfazed. I couldn't wait to see how the actual visa application would go. And finally, I was called up.

To my relief, the agent was the friendlier one this time. I told him the same things that I said yesterday, and he sent me back to my seat while he considered. As I said before, I rarely get nervous even in the most stressful situation; this however, had me shaking. In retrospect I think I was being a little bit dramatic, but after waiting for over 10 hours in total I was very invested in the outcome.

As I said, I think luck is a huge factor in stuff like this, and is why I got denied the day before. The documents I had today were, frankly speaking, 99% similar to what I then. I didn't say anything new either to explain my role. The entire difference, in my mind, comes from the fact that I got the young friendly border agent this time, as opposed to my previous stricter one. Even luckier, the one from yesterday wasn't in today.

The new agent asked a few questions to figure out why he denied me. I think that my application looked good overall (since, of course, everybody else got the TN visa just fine) but also didn't want to completely undermine the other agent's decision.
