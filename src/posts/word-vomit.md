> I’d rather be a failure at something I love than a success at something I hate. – George Burns

On a warm, fateful, July day, about 7 months ago. I started this blog. I was filled with a sense of excitement; the starry eyed wonder at beginning a new project, not knowing it would take me. Such charged moments, filled with equal parts anticipation and nervousness, are some of my favorite ones to experience. I set out with just one goal: to write.

Since then, in the 218 days that have passed (at the time of writing), I have ~~struggled with~~ happily written 7 posts. They aren't perfect, but they're real and that's what matters. It's all too easy to fall for the trap of perfection, which I've found doesn't actually help you be any better of a creator. All it does it make it harder to get words out from your brain and onto the page. In this way perfection is kind of like an optical illusion, to get there you can't walk directly towards it.

My keen eyed readers will notice that this comes out to slightly less than 1 post a month, something which I am not too pleased about. One of my long term goals with this, and I think any creative hopes for this, is to amass a large body of work so that I will one day look back on it with satisfaction. It's been over six months since I started this blog and by now I think I'm pretty committed to sticking with this for the long haul. Although there have been rough patches, for the most part I've always felt motivated and engaged and there's something really satisfying about putting stuff up on the internet where it will (hopefully) last forever. The more I write, the more I realize I want to keep writing.

My pace so far is respectable, but I think I could do better. Not by pushing myself to exhaustion, as that road leads only to burning out and disappointment. Rather, I think I have a way to harness the natural curiosity and rhythms of my brain to create even more prolifically than I already have. I'm excited to show you all the solution I've been working on, but first I'd like to take a moment to remind myself, and all of you, about part of what inspires me to write.

## Writing That Transcends Time and Space

> "What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic." - Carl Sagan  

Like I said once, I write primarily for myself. But, as a very close second, I write for others like me. Whether they are alive today, or will see these words after centuries, they are my people. Whether they are other people around me or future versions of myself, I think about them every time I click post.

I've been reading history recently, mostly Roman. Some of the words I read have been written over two thousand years ago. These thoughts have escaped these ancient people's brains and have transcended so many barriers to reach mine. Culturally, linguistically, technologically; it's a miracle I can know what Marcus Tullius Cicero, a man who lived over 2000 years ago and before Christianity was founded, liked to do for fun. Could my thoughts make the same journey someday? Are some of them already doing so? It's intoxicating to think that in a hundred or a thousand years some future generations, some of mine or your descendants even, could be reading these very words.

I guess I've been thinking about legacy lately. Not in a _oh no we're all going to die soon_ way but more of a _it's such a privilege that we each are able to leave our unique and special impacts on the world_. Not as something that happens in one grand event at the will reading after you die, but instead as small pieces you build around you each and every day. I like to think that no matter how small and insignificant a life, every person's actions leaves an indelible impact on the world around them and permanently changes it for the better, butterfly effect style. We are all small but essential notes in the great symphony of humanity.

What will I leave behind? Well I used to feed squirrels, maybe some of their acorns will be moved to spots they otherwise wouldn't have and sprout into a great oak tree. I enjoy playing with children, maybe as they grow older the shadow of a memory of the kindness I showed them will spur them to be just that much more gracious. And, most importantly, there is this very blog (and other associated writing I'm sure) that I have to believe will reach the ears that need them.

Anyway, I digress. I don't want to get morbid, but I hope now you have some context for why I'm doing this. Why I want to increase my writing output, why I want to become a better writer. The flame in me burns hot and bright tonight. If you lean in, perhaps you may feel its warmth.

# Quantity over Quality

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit" - Aristotle.

There is a wild beast inside each of us that is impossible to tame. It will want to run in circles one minute, rant about video games the next, and will sometimes want nothing more than to scroll TikTok for hours on end. At least, that's what mine tends to want. Some of you may refer to them as your inner child.

Even if this beast cannot be entirely civilized, their path of reckless whimsy can be loosely guided. The key is not to fight them head on, as they will always outlast you in a battle of perseverance. Instead, like the graceful matador with his bull, you must master the art of misdirection. Trick the monster into 


> The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. 

> His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to get an “A”.

> Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

# Dare to Dream Bigger

> "I would much rather be disappointed from occasionally not getting what I want, than living a small life where I refuse to allow myself to want anything." - visakanv

The beautiful thing about change is you never notice getting better at something. It only hits you in spectacular moments of surprise. Like a friend who only shows you highlight reels of your best moments, instead going one by one. 

I love commitments, challenges, bets, oaths; all of that stuff.
